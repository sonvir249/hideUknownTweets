## What does the script do?

The script targets Twitter's homepage and searches for tweets from accounts that the user may not wish to see. It hides these tweets by applying a style of "display: none" to the relevant HTML elements.

## How does the script work?

The script identifies the HTML elements that contain tweets by searching for the "cellInnerDiv" data-testid attribute. It then searches for links within these elements and extracts the href attribute value.

Using the href attribute value, the script creates a CSS selector and uses it to find the corresponding HTML element. It then dispatches a "mouseover" event on the element to trigger the appearance of the hover card.

Once the hover card appears, the script checks whether it contains the "Click to Follow" button and whether the account's href attribute matches the one previously extracted. If both conditions are met, the script applies the `display: none` style to both the hover card and the tweet element.

The script also includes an event listener that runs the function whenever the user scrolls on the page.
